## Topic Chosen:
# L1 — Intelligent Academic Planner and Learning Activity Optimization Platform:
This project focuses on developing an intelligent academic planning and productivity support
platform designed to help students manage coursework, deadlines, examinations, and extracurricular commitments more effectively. Unlike simple scheduling or reminder applications, this
system should integrate AI-based workload analysis, recommendation models that propose optimal study sessions, and behaviour analytics that help students recognize patterns such as
procrastination or burnout. The platform may generate personalized learning plans based on
academic intensity, time availability, and historical performance while preserving student autonomy and privacy. Ethical considerations such as transparency of recommendations, avoidance
of manipulative nudging, and fair treatment of different learning styles should be central to the
design. The system should demonstrate thoughtful UX design and accessibility to support a
diverse student population.
